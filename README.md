# Prediction of Asthma from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Feature Selection (FS)

As the most common genetic variation responsible for trait and disease, SNP has been studied extensively in disease research. Nevertheless, SNP which is high dimensional tends to cause overfitting and therefore lower the classification accuracy. This research is aimed to propose hybridFS to identify significant SNPs, followed by SVM model to predict asthma. Results show that the proposed model is outperformed the existing model with an average accuracy, precision, recall, and Area under the Curve (AUC) of 98.91%, 98.36%, 99.72% and 0.99 when considering 350 SNPs. The top five selected SNPs has been reviewed through biological context and some genes of the selected SNPs, including Ring Finger Protein 217 (RNF217) and A-kinase-anchoring protein 6 (AKAP6) are correlated with respiratory diseases.
